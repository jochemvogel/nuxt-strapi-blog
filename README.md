# Nuxt Strapi GraphQL MongoDB Boilerplate

Yeah. I've to admit: that's a lot.

This is a repo for the code of an article I wrote on [Medium](https://jochemvogel.medium.com/how-to-create-a-static-nuxt-blog-with-the-headless-strapi-cms-and-graphql-a9cfb3d55cef).

Read the article to get this project locally installed. ðŸ˜‰ Will add some documenation/configuration later on.

This boilerplate is based on the idea of creating a static Nuxt app with dynamic data from the Strapi CMS. Data is stored in MongoDB (Atlas) and retrieved through GraphQL.

This gives you the possibility to generate the frontend statically.
