# Nuxt Strapi GraphQL Boilerplate

This is a repo for the code of an article I wrote on [Medium](https://jochemvogel.medium.com/how-to-create-a-static-nuxt-blog-with-the-headless-strapi-cms-and-graphql-a9cfb3d55cef).

Read the article to get this project locally installed. ðŸ˜‰ Will add some documenation/configuration later on.

This boilerplate is based on the idea of creating a static Nuxt app with dynamic data from the Strapi CMS. Data is stored in MongoDB (Atlas) and retrieved through GraphQL.

This gives you the possibility to generate the frontend statically.

Front-end is hosted on Netlify and back-end on Heroku.
